# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Daniel Zelei, a software engineer specializing in Python, Rust, and Flutter (Dart), with a solid foundation in Java. As a Google Cloud Architect Certified professional, I have extensive experience in designing and implementing cloud-based solutions and modern web applications. My diverse skill set enables me to tackle complex problems and adapt to various technological environments efficiently.

I am collaborating with others to dedicate increasing amounts of time to working with Rust. Together, we have consolidated our projects within the "rust-dd" organization. You can explore the **rust-dd** organization [here](https://github.com/rust-dd/).
