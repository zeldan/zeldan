# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Daniel Zelei, a software engineer with extensive experience in Java, particularly with Spring Boot. In the past 4-5 years, I've expanded my expertise to include Python, Rust, TypeScript, and Flutter (Dart) due to my evolving role at my company. This diverse technical background allows me to approach problems with a unique perspective and adaptability.
